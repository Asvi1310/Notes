# Core Java


**Features of java**
 oops concept:
 Platform independent: A single program can work on different platforms without any modifications
 High Performance:
 Multi Threaded: A flow of execution is known as a thread. JVM creates a thread which is called the main thread. The user can create 
                 multiple threads by extending thread class or by implementing the runnable interface.
                 
 **Constructor**
 constructor is a block of code which is similiar to a method. It is called when an instance of object is created and memory is allocated 
 for that object. Java compiler creates a default constructor when a class does not any constructor. It is used to initialize the state of 
 object and invoked implicitly. Constructor name must be same as its parent class name.
